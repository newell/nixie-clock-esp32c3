 ### TODO
- [ ] Motion Sleep Mode
- [ ] Hourly Slot Machine and LED cycling

## CAD Model of Clock Case

To design the clock case I used [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) (you can [read the docs here](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

## Clock Control Interface

This project contains a web-based interface to control settings for the clock. The interface is served by the ESP32-C3 and can be accessed at [esp-home.local](http://esp-home.local).

### Features

- **Real-Time Control**: Adjust clock settings in real-time using WebSockets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Customizable Settings**: Change various clock settings like time, timezone, 24 or 12 hour format, display color and brightness, and more.

## Design

This section contains some behind the scenes of the various stages of designing the clock, including prototyping, debugging, and iterative improvements. 

### Handsoldered PCB Testing and Debugging

- [x] Display current time synced with NTP
- [x] LEDs
- [x] Sound

### Single Tube

Before receiving my ESP32-C3 development board, I tested the ability to toggle numbers on a Nixie tube and verified the functionality of my homemade high voltage power supply. I created a boost converter using the toner transfer method. This DC-DC converter takes a +12VDC input and outputs approximately +170VDC. I used an Arduino Due board to cycle through the numbers on the Nixie tube.

### Six Tubes Toggling

Upon receiving my ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 development board, I wired up all six Nixie tubes on a breadboard using K155ID1 1601 DIP16 chips to drive the tubes. On the final PCB, I used SMT transistors to drive each pin of the tubes individually through shift registers.

### Six Tubes NTP Time and Sound

Next, I wrote code for the ESP32-C3 to update its time via NTP and drive the tubes accordingly (details are in the code). Additionally, I successfully integrated sound using codecs and a power amplifier.

### LEDs

Added code to have the ESP32-C3 drive some LEDs.  There are LEDs underneath each tube on the clock.
